# Depth-from-Focus-using-Windowed-Linear-Least-Squares-Regressions
MATLAB Implementation of Depth from Focus algorithm and Python notebook for ceramics depth estimation

The full algorithm can be runned in the `main.m` Matlab file.

For ceramics glazed depth measurement, Depth from focus can be runned in the `main_ceramics.m` Matlab file in order to generate a pkl file that can be studied in the `ceramics_depth_measurement.ipynb` Jupiter notebook file.
